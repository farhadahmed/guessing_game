The object of the superhero guessing game is to have the user guess which superhero the browser
has chosen.  The user will have 6 tries total.

We adjusted the game to help the user by asking them which DC or Marvel superhero we were thinking of. To do that we replaced the existing array with two new ones (one for each universe), and write code to choose between the two arrays, and then adapt the existing code that chose the answer to match the new variable names.
